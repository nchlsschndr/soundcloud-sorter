# SoundCloud Sorter

![alt text](preview.png "Logo Title Text 1")

A small script for Grease-/Tampermonkey. Adds sort buttons to the SoundCloud control bar. Works for /likes, /tracks and /reposts. On /likes, the waveform view has to be active. Scroll down to load some (or all) tracks, then press a button to sort them.
