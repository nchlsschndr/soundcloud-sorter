A small script for Grease-/Tampermonkey based on [SoundCloud Extensions by xerg0n](https://github.com/xerg0n/soundcloud_extentions).

Adds sort buttons to the SoundCloud control bar. Works for /likes, /tracks and /reposts. On /likes, the waveform view has to be active. Scroll down to load some (or all) tracks, then press a button to sort them.
